## 📋 What We're Doing
We're going to put your website files on GitHub so it can be live at `https://triplepower.github.io`

## STEP 1: Create GitHub Repository (On Website)

1. **Open your web browser** (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)

2. **Go to GitHub**: https://github.com
   - If you don't have an account, create one (it's free)

3. **Sign in** to your GitHub account

4. **Click the "+" icon** (top right corner) → Click **"New repository"**

5. **Fill in the form**:
   - **Repository name**: Type exactly: `Triplepower.github.io`
     - ⚠️ Replace "Triplepower" with YOUR GitHub username if different
   - **Description**: (Optional) "My personal website"
   - **Visibility**: Select **"Public"** (required for free hosting)
   - **DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
   - **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore"
   - **DO NOT** check "Choose a license"

6. **Click green button**: "Create repository"

7. **You'll see a page** that says "Quick setup" - **DON'T DO ANYTHING HERE YET**
   - Just leave this page open, we'll come back to it

## STEP 2: Find Your Project Folder (On Your Computer)

1. **Open File Explorer** (Windows Key + E)

   ```

3. **You should see these files**:
   - index.html
   - styles.css
   - script.js
   - README.md
   - .gitignore

4. **Keep this folder open** - we'll need it in the next step

## STEP 3: Upload Files to GitHub (Easiest Method - No Git Needed!)

### Option A: Upload via GitHub Website (RECOMMENDED - Easiest!)

1. **Go back to your GitHub repository page**:
   - Should be at: `https://github.com/Triplepower/Triplepower.github.io`
   - If you closed it, go to: https://github.com/Triplepower/Triplepower.github.io

2. **Click the button**: "uploading an existing file" (or "Add file" → "Upload files")

3. **Drag and drop ALL files** from your folder:
   - Drag `index.html` into the box
   - Drag `styles.css` into the box
   - Drag `script.js` into the box
   - Drag `README.md` into the box
   - Drag `.gitignore` into the box (if you see it)

4. **Scroll down** to the bottom of the page

5. **Type in the box**: "Initial commit" (this is the commit message)

6. **Click green button**: "Commit changes"

7. **Wait 10-20 seconds** - you should see all your files appear!

## STEP 4: Enable GitHub Pages (Make Website Live)

1. **On your repository page**, click **"Settings"** (top menu, far right)

2. **Scroll down** on the left sidebar, click **"Pages"**

3. **Under "Source"**:
   - **Branch**: Click dropdown, select **"main"** (or "master" if main doesn't exist)
   - **Folder**: Select **"/ (root)"**
   - Click **"Save"** button

4. **You'll see a message**: "Your site is live at https://triplepower.github.io"
   - ⚠️ It might take 1-2 minutes to actually work

5. **Wait 2 minutes**, then visit: `https://triplepower.github.io`
   - Your website should be live! 🎉

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "No results for main//(root)"
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you uploaded files first (Step 3)
- Try selecting "master" instead of "main" in the branch dropdown

### Problem: Website shows 404 error
**Solution**: 
- Wait 2-3 minutes (GitHub needs time to build)
- Refresh the page
- Check that files were uploaded correctly

### Problem: Can't find my folder
**Solution**: 
- Open File Explorer
- Go to: `C:\Users\vineshh\snake-water-gun-game\Triplepower.github.io`
- Or search for "Triplepower.github.io" in File Explorer

### Problem: Files won't upload
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you're dragging files, not the folder
- Upload one file at a time if needed
- Make sure you're on the repository page (not GitHub homepage)
